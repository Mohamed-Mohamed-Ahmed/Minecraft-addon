# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Minecraft x Hunter: Nen Mobs

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A Minecraft addon that adds a mob to the game

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

For My project i will create a Minecraft mob that interacts with the player in game. The mob will be named after the hunter x hunter character Gon Freecss. I'm also planning on creating a Nen/Aura system just like in the anime.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will create my character, and give it the ability to navigate freely in the world.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Make gon hostile
Add animations
Add death drops

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Making a nen/aura system

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

For my next steps, I will begin by researching and familiarizing myself with Minecraft modding, specifically with bridge, as this platforms will allow me to implement custom mechanics like the Nen/Aura system and design custom mobs. I will need to learn how to create custom entities and mobs, and how to manipulate player stats, health, and abilities through code.
